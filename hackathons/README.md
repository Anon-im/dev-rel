# Hacker Handbook
Aztec Protocol is an encrypted zkRollup that combines Ethereum smart contracts with encrypted execution, offering developers both privacy and scalability. 

Aztec that allows developers to access both public and private state machines for flexible and confidential transactions. 

A key part of this protocol is [Noir](https://noir-lang.org/), an open-source zk circuit writing language that simplifies the creation of private smart contracts.
