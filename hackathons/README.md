# Hacker Handbook
Aztec is an L2 that brings programmable privacy to Ethereum.

Aztec allows developers to access both public and private state machines for flexible and confidential transactions. 

A key part of the Aztec ecosystem is [Noir](https://noir-lang.org/), an open-source zk circuit writing language that simplifies the creation of private smart contracts. This language is developed by the Aztec team, and forms the basis of the [Aztec.nr](https://docs.aztec.network/dev_docs/contracts/main) framework for writing smart contracts.

Learn more about our mission in our blog post [here](https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/aztec-the-hybrid-zkrollup-a90a197bf22e).
And more about what we're currently working on in this blog post about the [Aztec Sandbox](https://aztec.network/blog/announcing-aztec-sandbox-the-endgame-for-smart-contract-privacy/)
