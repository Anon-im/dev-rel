# Hacker Handbook

Aztec is an L2 that brings programmable privacy to Ethereum.

Aztec allows developers to access both public and private state machines for flexible and confidential transactions.

A key part of the Aztec ecosystem is [Noir](https://noir-lang.org/), an open-source zk circuit writing language that simplifies the creation of private smart contracts. This language is developed by the Aztec team, and forms the basis of the [Aztec.nr](https://docs.aztec.network/dev_docs/contracts/main) framework for writing smart contracts.

Learn more about our mission in our blog post [here](https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/aztec-the-hybrid-zkrollup-a90a197bf22e).
And more about what we're currently working on in this blog post about the [Aztec Sandbox](https://aztec.network/blog/announcing-aztec-sandbox-the-endgame-for-smart-contract-privacy/)

In this hacker handbook, youâ€™ll find

- [Inspiration](INSPIRATION.md) of ZK project ideas for playing around with Aztec & Noir or entering hackathons
- How to [better your chances of winning](#hackathon-success-guide-) an Aztec prize at a hackathon. You can see more cool Noir projects in the [Inspiration page](./INSPIRATION.md#cool-noir-projects)
- A [list of projects and tooling](TOOLS.md) that you can utilize or build on top of

Also be sure to check out [this list of resources](../README.md)

## Hackathon success guide ðŸ’»

### Getting started on Noir

See the [Getting Started](https://noir-lang.org/getting_started/nargo_installation/) section of the Noir docs to get set up with Noir.

### Getting started on Aztec

#### Sandbox

The Aztec Sandbox is an environment for local development on the Aztec Network. It's easy to get setup with just a single, simple command, and contains all the components needed to develop and test Aztec contracts and applications.

Follow the quickstart [here](https://sandbox.aztec.network/).

#### Deploying an example contract

Find more information about the sandbox and how to deploy a token contract to Aztec [here](https://aztec-docs-dev.netlify.app/dev_docs/getting_started/cli#i-have-the-sandbox-running-now-what).

#### Writing private programs with aztec.nr

Noir is a ZKDSL for writing zk circuits and verifying them on-chain. [Aztec.nr](http://Aztec.nr) is a smart contract framework -- written in Noir -- that has types and methods for rich smart contract semantics.

## Submission tips

When you are ready to submit your project, please provide:

- Git repo
- A video or demo showcasing your project
- An explainer of how Aztec or Noir is utilized, and why it was chosen over another protocol
